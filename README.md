##How to use:

Make sure to have NodeJS installed and the required modules, you can install them if you need by executing the following command:
`npm install <name>`
After that, download the yolo.js and place it somewhere accessable. In your terminal cd into the directory and execute `node yolo.js` and answer all of the required questions.

##Tips

Make it easer to start the script on windows by creating a file called `yolo.bat` in the same directory with the following code:
```
@echo off
node yolo.js
```
So when you use the script, all you do is double click the file to start it up.
